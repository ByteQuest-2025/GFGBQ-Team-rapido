# 🛡️ VeriFund | Transparent NGO Fund Utilization Tracker

> **Problem:** $40B+ in annual donations are lost to mismanagement.  
> **Solution:** A blockchain-inspired "Trust Protocol" that ensures every dollar reaches its intended destination through milestone-gating and verifiable evidence.

---

## 🏆 The Vision
VeriFund was built for the **ByteQuest 2025 Hackathon** to solve the "Black Hole" of charitable giving. Current platforms focus on *collecting* money; we focus on *tracking* it. We bridge the trust gap between donors and NGOs by making impact measurable, immutable, and visible in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Milestone-Based Fund Release (Smart Escrow)
Funds are not handed over in a lump sum. They are locked in a digital vault and released in **tranches** only after a verified third-party validator approves a project milestone.

### 2. Evidence-to-Transaction Mapping
Every expense is tied to a **Proof of Impact** (receipts, GPS-tagged photos, or digital signatures). Each record is assigned a unique cryptographic hash to ensure the data is tamper-proof.

### 3. The "Dollar Journey" Dashboard
Donors can follow their specific contribution through a vertical timeline—from the moment of donation to the final purchase of supplies or completion of a project.

### 4. Triple-Stakeholder Governance
- **NGOs:** Request funds by providing proof of work.
- **Validators:** Independent auditors who verify milestones.
- **Donors:** Real-time visibility and "Impact Badges" for successful projects.
