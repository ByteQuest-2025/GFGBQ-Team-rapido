## 📖 Project Overview
VeriFund is a transparency-first platform designed to restore donor trust. We solve the "Black Box" donation problem by using a **Milestone-Gating Protocol**. 

Unlike traditional platforms, VeriFund does not release funds in a lump sum. Instead, funds are held in a secure vault and released in tranches only after an NGO provides verifiable evidence (receipts/GPS-tagged photos) that is approved by an independent validator.
